# Road Traffic Accident Identification

__Context__: After collecting several road traffic accidents recorded in X city, as a data scientist in a government institution, you finally came up to analyze the records to find the causes of accidents on the road. Besides that, you might want to predict the severity of accidents based on the records for emergency response, so when there's an accident, the response team can **quickly** guess the severity of an accident to plan how many rescue force and equipment are needed, such as helicopter rescue, based on the information collected from the calls.

__Theoretical Basis__: According to World Health Organization (WHO), vehicle speed is the core of road accidents problem. Speeding influences both crash risk and its consequences. This factor is also influenced by many factors, divided into four groups: 
1. Road related, such as the road width, alignment, layout, surroundings, markings, and surface quality;
2. Vehicle related, such as vehicle type, condition, and speed;
3. Environment related, such as weather, surface condition, lighting, signs, zones, law, and speed limit;
4. Driver related, such as age, sex, attitudes, fatigue, alcohol level, vehicle ownership, hazard perception, and reaction time.
